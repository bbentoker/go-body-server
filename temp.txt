read the db schema v2 and and the LogicDocumentation-Services,PackagesReservations.md

Frontend needs the following routes for admins 

get services  , this will use service controller to get the services 

add services , use service controller 
add service variant , use service controller 
also other cruds too in the same way   

add packages , could have multiple uses of same service or may have multiple different service ,create a new controller for this named packge contoller 


try to add the routes to the admin routes but the controllers and services must be defined in the right name for each model and can be used in differnet places 
to make sure data integrity when operating

and generate detailed docs showing the payloads too
